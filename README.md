## Hi there 👋

I'm not a developer, a data scientist, programmer, engineer, or any other cool-sounding thing. Just here for fun because I like computers and hacky stuff.

I love SQL, and will pronounce it 'sequel' or 'ess-queue-elle' with no consistency.  

python was my first love, but I'm peering into the R universe.

My favourite projects are currently [marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo), [Quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto), and [duckdb](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb). Here you will find power and joy.
